It's a stunning white marble mausoleum located in Agra, India, and it's considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.\n\nShah Jahan commissioned the construction of the Taj Mahal in 1632, and it took around 22 years to complete, with thousands of workers and artisans laboring to create this incredible monument.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is not only a testament to the love of Shah Jahan for his wife but also a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, blending Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the Taj Mahal or Shah Jahan?"
